Functional Programming :
  This programming paradigm emphasizes on the use of functions where each function performs a specific task.
  Fundamental elements used are variables and functions.The data in the functions are immutable(cannot be changed after creation).
  Importance is not given to data but to functions.
  It follows declarative programming model.
  It uses recursion for iteration.
  It is parallel programming supported.
  Does not have any access specifier.
  No data hiding is possible. Hence, Security is not possible.
  
  
Object Oriented Programming:
  This programming paradigm is based on object oriented concept. Classes are used where instance of objects are created
  Fundamental elements used are objects and methods and the data used here are mutable data.
  Importance is given to data rather than procedures.
  It follows imperative programming model.
  It uses loops for iteration.
  It does not support parallel programming.
  The statements in this programming paradigm need to follow a order i.e., bottom up approach while execution.
  Has three access specifiers namely, Public, Private and Protected.
  Provides data hiding. Hense, secured programs are possible.
